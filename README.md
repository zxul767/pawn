A chess engine and machine learning testbed

Originally written as a project to investigate AI techniques, Pawn is now at a decent strength to beat average players. It has been tested against some popular enginess (such as GnuChess) as part of its training to evolve with some satisfactory results.

I will be adding details about its architecture and the research behind it later on.
